CoreTide is a platform that has been built for the better part of the past 2 years at the EC, and builds on top of years of astute observations of what goes wrong in the detection engineering field. It is an opinionated end-to-end platform, data model, framework and solution built on top of DevOps and as-code principles, with an emphasis on traceability, consistency, safety and automation. The knowledge-graph data architecture of CoreTide scales from the input of a threat intelligence signal to the deployment of a detection rule whilst maintaining strong relations between actors, threat, detection objectives, and rules using a UUID system.
