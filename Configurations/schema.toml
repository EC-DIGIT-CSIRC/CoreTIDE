[templates]
# Allows to insert templates by interacting with the JSON
# schema and the template generation algorithm.
# In metaschema, the special keyword tide.config.template is used
# to point to the schema path. We prefer to use scoped, non nested
# keys to avoid confusing the TOML parser with structures too complicated.
