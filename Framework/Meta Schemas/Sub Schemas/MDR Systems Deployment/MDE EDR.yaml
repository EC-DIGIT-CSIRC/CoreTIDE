      Select the frequency by which the query will run and trigger alerts. If you set it to run less frequently, it will have a longer lookback duration.

      Queries that run every 24 hours check the past 30 days.
      Queries that run every 12 hours check the past 48 hours.
      Queries that run every 3 hours check the past 12 hours.
      Queries that run every hour check the past 4 hours.
      Queries that run continuously check events as they are ingested into Microsoft Defender XDR.

      NRT is supported for specific tables and columns. Please see the documentation for more details.
