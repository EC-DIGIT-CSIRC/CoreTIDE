This may increase the capabilities of the now-elevated process or reduce its probability of detection.For access token impersonation an adversary can use standard command-line shell to initiate 'runas' commands or to use payloads that call Windows token APIs directly.

Also dubbed Baron Samedit (a play on Baron Samedi and sudoedit), sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via \"sudoedit -s\" and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.When sudo runs a command in shell mode, either via the -s or -i command line option, it escapes special characters in the command\u2019s arguments with a backslash. The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn\u2019t expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell mode.In the command line parsing code, it is possible to run sudoedit with either the -s or -i options, setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a command is not actually being run, sudo doesn't escape special characters. The code than may decides whether to remove the escape characters and will not check whether a command is actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency is what makes the bug exploitable."

For example -f or -l can be used to edit this file or list which commands or binaries the current user has access to run.GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems. GTFOBins allows to search for binaries or commands to check whether when executed as sudo they provide access to normally restricted actions. The repo list contains 300+ commandsthat could be abused for different purposes if not configured using this filter.The current list https://gtfobins.github.io/#+sudo is an open collaborativeproject.tar option can be exploited to write to arbitrary files (works only for GNU tar)If write data to files, it may be used for privileged writes or write files ouside a restricted file system.

Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured are used in embedded systems.\n\nhttps://d3fend.mitre.org/dao/artifact/d3f:EmbeddedComputer"
