    description: |
      In order for the Council to be able to work in all areas which require the use of EU classified information (EUCI),
      it needs to have a comprehensive security system to protect this information. The Council decision on the security
      rules for protecting EU classified information lays down the basic principles and minimum standards of security for
      protecting EUCI. These principles and standards apply to the Council and its General Secretariat, and they also need
      to be respected by member states when they handle EUCI.

      EU classified information is categorised into 4 levels which are defined by the severity of the impact of disclosure.
