    description: 'APT29 or also known as "the Dukes" are an enigmatic intrusion set,
      in which their activity usually is in waves ‚Äì launching daring raids but then
      disappearing for months before striking again. The group specialises in targeting
      Western Europe - particularly EU institutions - as well as NATO countries, former
      Soviet bloc, and the United States. Much of the Dukes'' toolset is focused on
      long-term persistence, with the group biding its time to gain deep access into
      victim networks before striking.  APT29 are heavily reported about in open-source,
      linking the group to numerous tools that include MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, and OnionDuke.
      The group has been noted in the past for its use of novel (at the time) command-and-control
      (C&C) tactics, including controlling implants via Twitter. The group has not
      been observed using 0-day exploits in attacks, and rely more on social-engineering
      or targeting of unpatched systems to gain an initial foothold.  The ''WellMess''
      malware and campaign, discovered in 2020, was linked to APT29 by the UK''s NCSC.
      Also, the SUNBURST, SolarWinds compromise, and the ISO phishing campaign (sent
      from compromised mfa[.]gr) was linked to APT29 by Volexity.  Recently the groups
      seem to heavily use CobaltStrike as their first stage backdoor and custom Golang-based
      implants as their next stage backdoors. The infrastructure recently used seems
      to be owned, not compromised.  APT29 is threat group that has been attributed
      to Russia''s Foreign  Intelligence Service (SVR).They have operated since at
      least 2008,  often targeting government networks in Europe and NATO member countries,
      research institutes, and think tanks. APT29 reportedly compromised the  Democratic
      National Committee starting in the summer of 2015. '

      tools include TrickBot, Ryuk, Conti and BazarLoader.  FIN12/Wizard Spider Wizard
      Spider is reportedly associated with Grim Spider and Lunar Spider. The WIZARD
      SPIDER threat group is the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware.
      This group represents a growing criminal enterprise of which GRIM SPIDER appears
      to be a subset. The LUNAR SPIDER threat group is the Eastern European-based
      operator and developer of the commodity banking malware called BokBot (aka IcedID),
      which was first observed in April 2017. The BokBot malware provides LUNAR SPIDER
      affiliates with a variety of capabilities to enable credential theft and wire
      fraud, through the use of webinjects and a malware distribution function. GRIM
      SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating the Ryuk ransomware
      since August 2018, targeting large organizations for a high-ransom return. This
      methodology, known as ‚Äúbig game hunting,‚Äù signals a shift in operations for
      FIN12/Wizard Spider , a criminal enterprise of which GRIM SPIDER appears to
      be a cell. The FIN12/Wizard Spider threat group, known as the Russia-based operator
      of the TrickBot banking malware, had focused primarily on wire fraud in the
      past.  Conti is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group, which allows  affiliates
      to rent access to its infrastructure to launch attacks.  Experts say Conti is
      based in Russia and may have ties to Russian  intelligence. It is likely that
      Conti developers pay the deployers  of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage
      of the proceeds used by affiliate cyber actors and receives a share of the proceeds  from
      a successful attack.   During the Ukraine-Russia conflict, they published on
      internal chats that they will perform retaliation againt the West if  Russia
      is targeted by cyberattacks. As such, they can now be classified as terrorists,
      especially since they already deployed the ransomeware against public health
      services in the past, with  the intent to provoke damage, fear and panic. Accoridng
      to the leak, they also obeyed orders from the FSB in the past, attempting to
      hack  the independent news outlet "Bellingcat" '

    description: 'Since at least 2007 APT28 or Sofacy has employed a variety of methodologies
      and malware strains, including zero-day vulnerabilities and to perform spear
      phishing, watering holes, credential collection, and the exploitation of mobile
      platforms in the execution of global espionage campaigns. APT28 campaign targets
      indicate specific interest in the collection of information intended to provide
      political and military advantage. These operations have been detected primarily
      impacting entities across the public and private sectors.  Likely operating
      since the mid-2000s, Fancy Bear''s methods are consistent with the capabilities
      of state actors. The group targets government, military, and security organizations,
      especially Transcaucasian and NATO-aligned states. Fancy Bear is thought to
      be responsible for cyber attacks on the German parliament, the French television
      station TV5Monde, the White House, NATO, the Democratic National Committee,
      the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the campaign of

      interests of the Russian government, and is known for hacking Democratic National
      Committee emails to attempt to influence the outcome of the United States 2016
      presidential elections.  Sofacy (APT28) activity can be split into:  "Classic"
      Sofacy (Sednit) Zebrocy - access specialists  It is believed that Zebrocy take
      care about getting initial access to the victim (compromise) and they would
      often use Office attachments with malicious macros to maintain access. Sofacy
      can do the whole kill chain, including initial access - but instead of macros
      they were rather seen exploiting a 0-day vulnerabilities in Flash player + an
      elevation privilege 0-day vulnerability in Windows. Phishing activity has recently
      diminished.  APT28 also constantly run a campaign to harvest credentials to
      e-mail accounts (activity sometimes referred to as Credocy).  APT28 activity
      is associated with GRU unit.  Reports from 2020 show the actor has gone through
      complete re-tooling and using different implants now - these new implants are
      less sophisticated than before. Recently (2021) Sofacy''s activity seems to
      diminish and they have focused on credential theft, also performing password
      brute force attacks.  APT28 is one of the most advanced and well-resourced APTs.

    name: ZIRCONIUM
    description: 'ZIRCONIUM refers to a little reported-on Chinese espionage group
      that we suspect has been active for a great deal of time. In 2017, Fidelis released
      an article on a cyber operation they dubbed ‚ÄòOperation TradeSecret‚Äô, whereby
      the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) in the US was compromised to redirect
      visitors to the scanbox framework ‚Äì a reconnaissance/infiltration tool used
      by a multitude of Chinese groups. This was originally attributed to APT10 based
      on shared use of Scanbox between campaigns, however other sources have suggested
      this is instead attributable to APT31. Prior to this reporting we are unsure
      of any direct reporting on APT31‚Äôs activity.  In 2021 the actor started using
      a compromised botnet of SOHO routers, predominantly of the following vendors:
      Pakedge, Cyberoam and Crestron. Although we are trying to track this botnet,
      recently we have received an information that the attacker is now switching
      to Cisco routers (rv042).  ZIRCONIUM or also known as APT31 is a threat actor
      specialized on intellectual property theft related to companies'' patent, internal
      classified information or projects and documents related to particular organizational
      competitive purposes. This threat actor conducts network operations in interest
      and by order of the Chinese Government. Their targets include: upstream providers
      (law firms and managed service providers), lawmakers‚Äô email accounts, French
      or other organizations, phishing campaigns, tampering of election''s information,
      Parliaments in Europa (for example Finnish Parliament) and other high-profile
      targets.  Known toolset used by ZIRCONIUM:   - 9002 RAT - China Chopper webshell
      - Gh0st RAT - HiKit - PlugX - Sakula RAT - Trochilus RAT - Mimikatz - Sakula
      RAT - Trochilus RAT '

    name: APT19
    description: 'APT19 is Chinese-affiliated threat actor group targeting financial,
      technology, non-profit organisations. They are known to use three different
      methods to compromise their targets, which are RTF attachments that can exploit
      the Microsoft Windows vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199), macro-enabled Microsoft
      Excel (XLSM) documents or application level whitelisting bypass to the XLSM
      documents. This group is likely composed of freelancers, with some degree of
      sponsorship by the Chinese government.  Some analysts track APT19 and Deep Panda
      as the same group, but it is unclear from open source information if the groups
      are the same.  APT19 network traffic is observed to communicate with known COLDSTEEL
      IP addresses from multiple public and private entities in the U.S. and Japan
      conglomerates located abroad. COLDSTEEL is a multi-functional rare backdoor  that
      seems to be unique and related to APT19. The potential return of APT19, likely
      a Ministry of State Security asset, represents a global threat to numerous public
      and private entities in a vast array of industries.  This group is also known
      as Shell Crew, WebMasters, KungFu Kittens, and PinkPanther. APT19 or also known
      as "Deep Panda" appears to be known as Black Vine based on the attribution of
      both group names to the Anthem intrusion.   Known toolset used by APT19:  -
      BEACON - COBALTSTRIKE - Empire - DLL loaders - COLDSTEEL backdoor - Sakula/Sakurel
      - Derusbi - Scanbox Framework - Many Webshells including China Chopper - WCE '
