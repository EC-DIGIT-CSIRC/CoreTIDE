      HURRICANE PANDA''s preferred initial vector of compromise and persistence is
      a China Chopper webshell ‚Äì a tiny and easily obfuscated 70 byte text file that
      consists of an ‚Äòeval()‚Äô command, which is then used to provide full command

      is typically uploaded to a web server via a SQL injection or WebDAV vulnerability,
      which is often trivial to uncover in a company with a large external web presence.

      Once inside, the adversary immediately moves on to execution of a credential
      theft tool such as Mimikatz (repacked to avoid AV detection). If they are lucky
      to have caught an administrator who might be logged into that web server at
      the time, they will have gained domain administrator credentials and can now

      This adversary consistently leverages spear phishing emails containing malicious
      Microsoft Office documents, malware designed to target the Android mobile platform,
      and phishing activity designed to harvest user credentials. In March 2017, the

      APT-C-35. In June 2017, the 360 Threat Intelligence Center discovered the organization‚Äôs

      While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and Putter

      The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that

      activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government
      source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment
      that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the
      Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.

      The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and
      Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both
      the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily
      in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the

      Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations

      an article about Iran pressing Afghanr efugees to fight in Syria. While referencing
      a real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director‚Äôs biography
      and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing
      attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering
      tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical
      and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors demonstrated
      stronger English-language proficiency than past intrusion sets and a deeper
      investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated
      a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject,
      then offered validation through links to their biography and social media, the
      former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents contained a real
      article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message attempted
      to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment.
      The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files
      using the common right-to-left filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual
      file extension. All of these techniques, while common pretexting mechanisms,
      are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to simply continually
      send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes that one would
      eventually be successful.'

      The FBI alert was issued in February and went largely unnoticed. Nearly a month

      mysterious group behind the attack.

      ‚ÄúThis is a rare alert and a little late, but one that is welcomed by all security

      customers received an update in mid-February 2017 on some interesting APT activity
      that we called WhiteBear. Much of the contents of that report are reproduced
      here. WhiteBear is a parallel project or second stage of the Skipper Turla cluster
      of activity documented in another private intelligence report ‚ÄúSkipper Turla
      ‚Äì the White Atlas framework‚Äù from mid-2016. Like previous Turla activity, WhiteBear
      leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for command
      and control (C2) infrastructure. As a matter of fact, WhiteBear infrastructure
      has overlap with other Turla campaigns, like those deploying Kopiluwak, as documented
      in ‚ÄúKopiLuwak ‚Äì A New JavaScript Payload from Turla‚Äù in December 2016. WhiteBear
      infected systems maintained a dropper (which was typically signed) as well as
      a complex malicious platform which was always preceded by WhiteAtlas module
      deployment attempts. However, despite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns,
      we believe that WhiteBear is a distinct project with a separate focus. We note
      that this observation of delineated target focus, tooling, and project context
      is an interesting one that also can be repeated across broadly labeled Turla
      and Sofacy activity.

      From February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on
      embassies and consular operations around the world. All of these early WhiteBear
      targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations.
      Continued WhiteBear activity later shifted to include defense-related organizations
      into June 2017. When compared to WhiteAtlas infections, WhiteBear deployments
      are relatively rare and represent a departure from the broader Skipper Turla
      target set. Additionally, a comparison of the WhiteAtlas framework to WhiteBear
      components indicates that the malware is the product of separate development
      efforts. WhiteBear infections appear to be preceded by a condensed spearphishing
      dropper, lack Firefox extension installer payloads, and contain several new
      components signed with a new code signing digital certificate, unlike WhiteAtlas
      incidents and modules.'

    description: 'This threat actor uses spear-phishing techniques to target parliaments,
      government ministries, academics, and media organizations, primarily in the
      Middle East, for the purpose of espionage.

      Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown
      geopolitically motivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017, with the
      attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access
      to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database
      of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of
      vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems range from personal desktop
      or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar.
      The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for
      telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.

      Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in
      the Middle East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the
      radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly
      careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding
      their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down since
      the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access
      was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior
      in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate
      information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical
      and/or digital).

      With deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors,
      attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially
      in complex regions such as the Middle East.'

      A security researcher who uses the online name SandboxEscaper on August 27 released

      in C:\Windows\Task.


      The vulnerability affects Windows versions 7 through 10 and can be used by an

      A couple of days after the exploit code became available (source and binary),

      a threat actor they call PowerPool, because of their tendency to use tools mostly

      for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its actual

      Like most campaigns, BLACKGEAR has evolved over time. Our research indicates
      that it has started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion:
      first, the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are

      Following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover
      the proverbial red string of fate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns:
      PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and of late, Waterbear.

      PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents.
      Active since 2012, it has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and
      private organizations. PLEAD‚Äôs toolset includes the self-named PLEAD backdoor
      and the DRIGO exfiltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing emails to deliver
      and install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud
      storage services. Some of the cloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are
      also used as drop off points for exfiltrated documents stolen by DRIGO.

      PLEAD actors use a router scanner tool to scan for vulnerable routers, after
      which the attackers will enable the router‚Äôs VPN feature then register a machine
      as virtual server. This virtual server will be used either as a C&C server or

      required to successfully compromise a target and steal sensitive information.
      The attackers use very simple malware, which required little development time
      or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web hosting, to implement a
      highly effective attack. It is a case of the attackers obtaining a maximum return
      on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need
      to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they
      are after. The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the
      victim. A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates
      the malware. The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the victim to open
      the email. For example, one email sent to an academic claimed to be a call for
      papers for a conference (CFP).

      The vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia.
      The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in
      the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to
      have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised
      computers. In other cases, the attackers used more of a ‚Äòshotgun‚Äô like approach,
      copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the
      focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen.
      45 different attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within
      the same IP address range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two
      were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that
      the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the
      attackers anonymous.√¶nThe attacks have been active from at least April 2011
      up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the
      minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero
      day exploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering
      and lax security measures on the part of the victims.'

      As part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy

    description: 'An unnamed source leaked almost 10,000 documents describing a large
      number of 0-day vulnerabilities, methodologies and tools that had been collected
      by the CIA. This leaking was done through WikiLeaks, since March 2017. In weekly
      publications, the dumps were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until
      his arrest in 2018.

      Most of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective
      vendors, by many have been used by other threat actors. This actor turned out
      to be a former CIA software engineer.

      (WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of
      leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named "Vault 7" by WikiLeaks,
      it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.

      The first full part of the series, "Year Zero", comprises 8,761 documents and
      files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA''s Center
      for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure
      last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead
      up to the 2012 presidential election.

      Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including
      malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized "zero day" exploits, malware remote control
      systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts
      to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the
      entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated
      among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner,
      one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.

      "Year Zero" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA''s global covert hacking
      program, its malware arsenal and dozens of "zero day" weaponized exploits against
      a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple''s iPhone,
      Google''s Android and Microsoft''s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned
      into covert microphones.'

    description: Proofpoint researchers have identified a targeted APT campaign that
      utilized malicious RTF documents to deliver custom malware to unsuspecting victims.
      We dubbed this campaign ‚ÄúOperation LagTime IT‚Äù based on entities that were targeted
      and the distinctive domains registered to C&C IP infrastructure. Beginning in
      early 2019, these threat actors targeted a number of government agencies in
      East Asia overseeing government information technology, domestic affairs, foreign
      affairs, economic development, and political processes. We determined that the
      infection vector observed in this campaign was spear phishing, with emails originating
      from both free email accounts and compromised user accounts. Attackers relied
      on Microsoft Equation Editor exploit CVE-2018-0798 to deliver a custom malware
      that Proofpoint researchers have dubbed Cotx RAT. Additionally, this APT group
      utilizes Poison Ivy payloads that share overlapping command and control (C&C)
      infrastructure with the newly identified Cotx campaigns. Based on infrastructure
      overlaps, post-exploitation techniques, and historic TTPs utilized in this operation,
      Proofpoint analysts attribute this activity to the Chinese APT group tracked
      internally as TA428. Researchers believe that this activity has an operational
      and tactical resemblance to the Maudi Surveillance Operation which was previously
      reported in 2013.

      some ways, FIN11 is reminiscent of APT1; they are notable not for their sophistication,
      but for their sheer volume of activity.(FireEye) Mandiant has also responded
      to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we‚Äôve only observed the group successfully
      monetize access in few instances. This could suggest that the actors cast a
      wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further
      exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security
      posture. Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish
      exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group‚Äôs
      shifting monetization methods‚Äîfrom point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware
      in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020‚Äîis part of a larger trend in which criminal
      actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and
      data theft extortion. Notably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security
      researchers call TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen, but we do not attribute
      TA505‚Äôs early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably.
      Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is
      complicated by the actors‚Äô use of criminal service providers. Like most financially
      motivated actors, FIN11 doesn‚Äôt operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group
      has used services that provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting,
      code signing certificates, and private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing
      work to these criminal service providers likely enables FIN11 to increase the

    description: GOLD BURLAP is a group of financially motivated criminals responsible
      for the development of the Pysa ransomware, also referred to as Mespinoza. Pysa
      is a cross-platform ransomware with known versions written in C++ and Python.
      As of December 2020, approximately 50 organizations had reportedly been targeted
      in Pysa ransomware attacks. The operators leverage 'name and shame' tactics
      to apply additional pressure to victims. As of January 2021, CTU researchers
      had found no Pysa advertisements on underground forums, which likely indicates
      that it is not operated as ransomware as a service (RaaS).

      Ramnit, the phonetic spelling of RMNet, the internal name of the core module,
      began operation in April 2010 and became widespread in July 2010. A particularly
      virulent file-infecting component of early Ramnit variants that spreads by modifying
      executables and HTML files has resulted in the continued prevalence of those
      early variants. Currently, Ramnit remains an actively maintained and distributed
      threat. The intent of Ramnit is to intercept and manipulate online financial
      transactions through modification of web browser behavior ('man-in-the-browser').

      May 2019. GandCrab was operated as a ransomware-as-a-service operation whereby
      numerous affiliates distributed the malware and split ransom payments with the
      core operators. GOLD GARDEN maintained exclusive control of the development
      of GandCrab and associated command and control (C2) infrastructure. Individual
      affiliates, of which there were frequently more than a dozen in operation simultaneously,
      coordinated the distribution of GandCrab through spam emails, web exploit kits,
      pay-per-install botnets, and scan-and-exploit style attacks. On May 31, 2019
      the operators announced they have halted operations with no intent to resume
      for unknown reasons. In April 2019 the operators of GOLD GARDEN transferred
      the source code of GandCrab to GOLD SOUTHFIELD who used it as the foundation
      of the REvil ransomware operation. GOLD SOUTHFIELD operates a similar affiliate
      program comprised largely of former GandCrab users and other groups recruited

      Necurs distributed malware such as GOLD DRAKE's Dridex (Bugat v5), GOLD BLACKBURN's
      TrickBot, and other families like Locky and FlawedAmmy. Necurs also distributed
      a large volume of email pushing securities 'pump and dump' scams, rogue pharmacies,

    description: EXOTIC LILY is a resourceful, financially motivated group whose activities
      appear to be closely linked with data exfiltration and deployment of human-operated
      ransomware such as Conti and Diavol. In early September 2021, the group has
      been obeserved exploiting a 0day in Microsoft MSHTML (CVE-2021-40444). Investigation
      lead researchers to believe that they are an Initial Access Broker (IAB) who
      appear to be working with the Russian cyber crime gang known as FIN12 (Mandiant,
      FireEye) / WIZARD SPIDER (CrowdStrike). This threat actor deploys tactics, techniques
      and procedures (TTPs) that are traditionally associated with more targeted attacks,
      like spoofing companies and employees as a means of gaining trust of a targeted
      organization through email campaigns that are believed to be sent by real human
      operators using little-to-no automation. Additionally and rather uniquely, they
      leverage legitimate file-sharing services like WeTransfer, TransferNow and OneDrive
      to deliver the payload, namely BUMBLEEBEE and BAZARLOADER, further evading detection
      mechanisms. This level of human-interaction is rather unusual for cyber crime
      groups focused on mass scale operations.

    description: 'BRONZE VAPOR is a targeted threat group assessed with moderate confidence
      to be of Chinese origin. Artefacts from tools associated with this group and
      open source reporting on related incidents indicate that BRONZE VAPOR have operated
      since at least 2017.  The group conducts espionage against multiple industries
      including semiconductors, aviation and telecommunications.  CTU researchers
      assess BRONZE VAPOR''s intent to be information theft, with operations focused
      on intellectual property (semiconductors) and personally identifiable information
      such as traveller records (aviation).  Compromise of telecommunications companies
      can yield personally identifiable information and meta data on client communications
      such as Call Data Records (CDR).


      Prior to 2019 their operational focus, with some exceptions, revolved around
      targets in East Asia particularity Taiwan with it''s thriving semiconductor
      industry. In 2021 details emerged in open source of attacks on at least one
      European semiconductor company believed to date back to 2017.  In 2019 BRONZE
      VAPOR attacked one of more entities in the European airlines sector. The group
      gains initial access via VPN services, may use spearphishing with ''Letter of
      Appointment'' themed lures, and deploys Cobalt Strike along with custom data
      exfiltration tools to target organizations.  Post-intrusion activity involves
      living-of-the-land using legitimate tools and commands available within victim
      environment as well as using AceHash for credential harvesting, WATERCYCLE for
      data exfiltration and STOCKPIPE for proxying information through Microsoft Exchange
      servers over email.


      BRONZE VAPOR uses a set of tactics that, although not individually unique, when
      viewed in aggregate create a relatively distinct playbook.  Intrusions begin
      with credential based attacks against an existing remote access solution (Citrix,
      VPN etc.) or B2B network access.  Cobalt Strike is deployed into the environment
      and further access is then conducted via Cobalt Strike Beacon and other features
      of the platform.  Sharphound is deployed to map out the victim''s Active Directory
      infrastructure and and collect critical information about the domain including
      important account names.  Command and control infrastructure is hosted on subdomains
      of Azure and Appspot services to blend in with legitimate traffic. The threat
      actor also registers their own domains for command and control, often with a
      "sync" or "update" related theme. WinRAR is commonly used for compressing data
      prior to exfiltration.  Filenames for these archives often involve a string
      of numbers and variations of the word "update".  Data is exfiltrated using WATERCYCLE
      to cloud based platforms such as OneDrive and GoogleDrive.'

      focus is espionage and relates to targets in Australia, Cambodia, Hong Kong,
      Singapore, and Vietnam. We track this activity as 'Aoqin Dragon'. The threat
      actor has a history of using document lures with pornographic themes to infect
      users and makes heavy use of USB shortcut techniques to spread the malware and
      infect additional targets. Attacks attributable to Aoqin Dragon typically drop
      one of two backdoors, Mongall and a modified version of the open source Heyoka
      project.

      The threat actors behind this campaign use spear-phishing as a means of initial

      institutions in at least five different French-speaking countries: Ivory Coast,
      Morocco, Cameroon, Senegal, and Togo.

      DangerousSavanna tends to install relatively unsophisticated software tools

      open-source projects such as Metasploit, PoshC2, DWservice, and AsyncRAT. The

      executable loaders and malicious documents, to ISO, LNK, JAR and VBE files in
      various combinations. The evolving infection chains by the threat actor reflect
      the changes in the threat landscape seen over the past few years as infection

      utilize the CreateSecurityGroup API to establish remote access and exhibit a
      consistent security group naming convention. Credential acquisition is believed
      to stem from compromised cloud access keys, often sourced from public code repositories.
      Notably, their activities do not include calls to AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress,
      suggesting a selective approach to escalation.

    name: Codefinger
    description: Codefinger is a ransomware group that targets Amazon S3 buckets by
      exploiting AWS‚Äôs Server-Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys to encrypt
      victim data. They utilize compromised AWS credentials to gain access and demand
      Bitcoin ransoms for the decryption keys, threatening to delete files if negotiations
      fail. The group has been observed abusing publicly disclosed AWS keys with permissions
      to read and write S3 objects, making recovery impossible without their cooperation.
      Halcyon has documented multiple incidents linked to Codefinger's data extortion
      campaign against organizations with unsecured infrastructure.

    name: Belsen Group
    description: The Belsen Group has exploited the CVE-2022-40684 vulnerability in
      Fortinet devices to compromise over 15,000 FortiGate firewalls, releasing detailed
      configurations and plaintext VPN credentials. Their leaked data, organized by
      country and IP address, primarily consists of configurations from FortiOS 7.0.6
      and 7.2.1, which were the last vulnerable versions before patches were issued.
      Security researcher Kevin Beaumont confirmed that the group leveraged this vulnerability
      to gain unauthorized access and warned of potential exploitation of CVE-2024-55591
      by similar threat actors. Fortinet has stated that the leaked data originates
      from older campaigns and not from any recent incidents.
