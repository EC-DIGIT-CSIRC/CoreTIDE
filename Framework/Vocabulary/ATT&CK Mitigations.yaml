      Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication
      sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations.
      Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences
      cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g.,
      excessive communication  attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands).  Devices
      performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI)

    description: 'Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions,
      or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially
      sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing
      services that should not be exposed from the internal network.  Restrict network
      access to only required systems and services. In addition, prevent systems from
      other networks or business functions (e.g., enterprise) from accessing critical
      process control systems. For example, in IEC 62443, systems within the same
      secure level should be grouped into a zone, and access to that zone is restricted
      by a conduit, or mechanism to restrict data flows between zones by segmenting
      the network. (Citation: IEC February 2019) (Citation: IEC August 2013)'
