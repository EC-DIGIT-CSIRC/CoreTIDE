    name: Clipboard
    description: The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for
      short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs. The
      clipboard is usually temporary and unnamed, and its contents reside in the computer's
      RAM. The clipboard is sometimes called the paste buffer. Windows, Linux and
      macOS support a single clipboard transaction. Each cut or copy overwrites the
      previous contents. Normally, paste operations copy the contents, leaving the
      contents available in the clipboard for further pasting.

  - id: d3f:FileSystem
    name: File System
    description: In computing, a file system or filesystem is used to control how
      data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, information placed in a
      storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one
      piece of information stops and the next begins. By separating the data into
      pieces and giving each piece a name, the information is easily isolated and
      identified. Taking its name from the way paper-based information systems are
      named, each group of data is called a "file". The structure and logic rules
      used to manage the groups of information and their names is called a "file system".

    description: 'Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), also known as intrusion detection
      and prevention systems (IDPS), are network security appliances that monitor
      network or system activities for malicious activity. The main functions of intrusion
      prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, log information about
      this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it.


      Intrusion prevention systems are considered extensions of intrusion detection
      systems because they both monitor network traffic and/or system activities for
      malicious activity. The main differences are, unlike intrusion detection systems,
      intrusion prevention systems are placed in-line and are able to actively prevent
      or block intrusions that are detected. IPS can take such actions as sending
      an alarm, dropping detected malicious packets, resetting a connection or blocking
      traffic from the offending IP address. An IPS also can correct cyclic redundancy
      check (CRC) errors, defragment packet streams, mitigate TCP sequencing issues,

      it.A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many
      people use the two terms interchangeably. A URL implies the means to access
      an indicated resource, which is not true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly
      to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email

      use to refer to that file. In some cases the open is performed by the first
      access. During the open, the filesystem may allocate memory for buffers, or
      it may wait until the first operation. Various other errors which may occur
      during the open include directory update failures, un-permitted multiple connections,
      media failures, communication link failures and device failures.

    name: Partition
    description: A partition is a region on secondary storage device created so that
      the region can be managed by itself; separate from any other regions (partitions)
      on that secondary storage device. Creating partitions is typically the first
      step of preparing a newly installed storage device, before any file system is
      created. The device stores the information about the partitions' locations and
      sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads
      before any other part of the disk. Each partition then appears to the operating
      system as a distinct "logical" storage device that uses part of the actual device.
      System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create, resize,
      delete, and manipulate the partitions. Partitioning allows the use of different
      filesystems to be installed for different kinds of files. Separating user data
      from system data can prevent the system partition from becoming full and rendering
      the system unusable. Partitioning can also make backing up easier. [Definition

      from in-memory partitions.]

      of the client(s), while a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server(s); a reverse

      A transaction log is a file (i.e., log) of the communications between a system
      and the users of that system, or a data collection method that automatically
      captures the type, content, or time of transactions made by a person from a

      a Web search engine and users searching for information on that Web search engine.


      Many operating systems, software frameworks and programs include a logging system.
      A widely used logging standard is syslog, defined in Internet Engineering Task

      if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly
      coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes
      essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program,
      or remote. This is a form of client-server interaction (caller is client, executor
      is server), typically implemented via a request-response message-passing system.
      The object-oriented programming analog is remote method invocation (RMI). The
      RPC model implies a level of location transparency.

    name: Stack Frame Canary
    description: Stack canaries, named for their analogy to a canary in a coal mine,
      are used to detect a stack buffer overflow before execution of malicious code
      can occur. This method works by placing a small integer, the value of which
      is randomly chosen at program start, in memory just before the stack return
      pointer. Most buffer overflows overwrite memory from lower to higher memory
      addresses, so in order to overwrite the return pointer (and thus take control
      of the process) the canary value must also be overwritten. This value is checked
      to make sure it has not changed before a routine uses the return pointer on
      the stack. This technique can greatly increase the difficulty of exploiting
      a stack buffer overflow because it forces the attacker to gain control of the
      instruction pointer by some non-traditional means such as corrupting other important
      variables on the stack.

      devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware
      functions without needing to know precise details of the hardware being used.
      A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications
      subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a routine
      in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends
      data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling
      program. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They

      places a program into memory so that it may be executed, various memory regions
      are allocated (in particular, as pages), corresponding to both the segments
      in the object files and to segments only needed at run time. For example, the

      \ the graphical file browsers of some operating systems, may resemble symbolic\
      \ links but differ in a number of important ways. One difference is what type\
      \ of software is able to follow them:\n\n - Symbolic links are automatically\
      \ resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic\
      \ link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic\
      \ links or not.\n\n - Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file\
      \ system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software\
      \ programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers)\
      \ treat them as references to other files.\n\nAnother difference are the capabilities\
      \ of the mechanism:\n\n - Microsoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination\
      \ by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic\
      \ links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path.\
      \ The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic\
      \ link share a common path prefix[clarification needed], but that prefix is\
      \ not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an archive file\
      \ that can be unpacked anywhere).\n\n- Microsoft Windows application shortcuts\
      \ contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas\
      \ POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute\
      \ or relative pathnames.\n\n- Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain\
      \ their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed.\
      \ Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed\
      \ Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are\
      \ interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files\
      \ and folders are moved across the network.[14] Additionally, in Windows 9x\
      \ and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before\
      \ proposing to delete it."

    description: A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device,
      typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing
      circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single, thin and flat package. Tablets,
      being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output
      (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones,
      the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones,
      with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally, and may not support
      access to a cellular network.

  - id: d3f:PasswordManager
    name: Password Manager
    description: 'A password manager is a software application or hardware that helps
      a user store and organize passwords. Password managers usually store passwords
      encrypted, requiring the user to create a master password: a single, ideally
      very strong password which grants the user access to their entire password database.
      Some password managers store passwords on the user''s computer (called offline
      password managers), whereas others store data in the provider''s cloud (often
      called online password managers). However offline password managers also offer
      data storage in the user''s own cloud accounts rather than the provider''s cloud.
      While the core functionality of a password manager is to securely store large
      collections of passwords, many provide additional features such as form filling
      and password generation.'

    name: Network Packet
    description: A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched
      network. Computer communications links that do not support packets, such as
      traditional point-to-point telecommunications links, simply transmit data as
      a bit stream. When data is formatted into packets, packet switching is possible
      and the bandwidth of the communication medium can be better shared among users
      than with circuit switching.

    name: Archive File
    description: An archive file is a file that is composed of one or more computer
      files along with metadata. Archive files are used to collect multiple data files
      together into a single file for easier portability and storage, or simply to
      compress files to use less storage space. Archive files often store directory
      structures, error detection and correction information, arbitrary comments,
      and sometimes use built-in encryption.

  - id: d3f:NetworkNode
    name: Network Node
    description: In telecommunications networks, a node (Latin nodus, 'knot') is either
      a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. The definition of a node
      depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node
      is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating,
      receiving, or transmitting information over a communications channel. A passive
      distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently
      not a node.
