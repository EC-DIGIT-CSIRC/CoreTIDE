      \ to begin with  \n3. [SANS Digital Forensics & Incident Response](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/training/courses)\
      \ trainings  \n\nOffensive Security trainings are in the list because to fight\
      \ a threat, you need to understand their motivation, tactics, and techniques.\

      \ background in fundamental disciplines \xE2\u20AC\u201D Networking, Operating\

      \ of a HTTP request and is used for content negotiation as outlined within [RFC1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#page-46).\
      \  User-agents may often be overlooked by adversaries, and as such provide a\
      \ valuable point of investigation.\n\n1. Retrieve the user-agent from the HTTP\
      \ header.\n2. Using the below methodology as a reference make a judgement as\
      \ to whether the user-agent provided is suspicious or not. \n\n**Indications\
      \ of suspicious user-agents based upon string analysis:**\n\n* The user-agent\
      \ is left empty.\n* The user-agent contains typos or deviations in capitilisation\
      \ that are different from known good user-agents.\n* The user-agent contains\
      \ a sequence of random characters or \"gibberish\" akin to those found within\
      \ MITRE ATT&CK [T1568.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002/).\
      \  \n* The user-agent contains code that would execute an XSS or SQL Injection\
      \ attack.\n\n**Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon reputational\
      \ analysis:**\n\n* The user-agent is not listed as a popular user-agent on reference\
      \ materials such as [WhatIsMyBrowser](https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/useragents/explore/).\n\
      * It should be noted that there is value in engaging with the community on particular\
      \ User-Agents, and this can often be done by leveraging a search engine such\
      \ as Google.\n\n **Contextualise your findings with knowledge from your environment.**\n\
      \n* Consider whether the user-agent is relevant for your SoE environment.  For\
      \ instance, the presence of Mac OS X user-agents in a Windows only environment.\n\
      * Consider performing long-tail analysis or clustering to identify anomalies\
      \ within your environment.\n\n### Important Considerations\n* User-Agents are\
      \ client-side generated and can be easily spoofed.  Many adversaries will default\
      \ to leveraging known-good user-agents to hide activity.\n* User-Agent analysis\
      \ should be combined with other analysis to improve the fidelity of the signal.\
      \ It is well known that many legitimate applications (especially custom applications)\
      \ will omit user-agent strings or utilise defaults associated with the popular\
      \ libraries. "
